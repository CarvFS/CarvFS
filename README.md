- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CarvFS
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in neural networks with applications in physical and chemical sciences. Also, I have interest in integral equation theories applied to liquid state physics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C and C++. I have interest in applying parallel programming (such as MPI and CUDA) to solve chemical and physical problems.
